This repository contains data, analyses and software to model mechanical properties of austempered ductile iron (ADI) and use heuristic optimization to search through discrete space of solutions (chemical composition, heat treatment parameters) for solution that fulfills conditions of norms for ADI and has a balance between cost and quality of production.
